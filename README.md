# SparvPipelineProxy

## To run the server

```sh
./build.sh

docker run -p 5002:5000 arthow4n/sparv-pipeline-proxy:latest

# Beware `curl -d` actually strips 책 into a and 채 into a so the output could be "wrong" because the input is already wrong.
# This command is just for presenting how to call the API.
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"languageCode":"swe","input":"Hall책 v채rld!"}' http://localhost:5002/annotate/sparv
```
